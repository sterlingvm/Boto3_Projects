# Boto3_Projects
This is a repo containing all of the work I've done utilizing boto3, the AWS SDK for Python

These scripts focus on iterating over resources in AWS, searching for their tag data, and assigning the resources to different predetermined teams in a resulting .csv file based on the tag data.
